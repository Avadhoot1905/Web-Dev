## Inline:
used to add a single characteristic

thw above code would be used to turn the bg to blue
#not_recommeneded 

## Internal:
useful to add to just one html doc

the above code would be used to turn the bg red

## External:
html and css files are separate. the css files are summoned using a code similar to the one below for it to apply to the whole website.
