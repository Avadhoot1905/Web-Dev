# 📚 My Dev Vault — A Beginner-Friendly Knowledge Base

Welcome to my **Obsidian vault**, a personal collection of everything I’ve learned throughout my development journey. From writing basic HTML to working with Docker and React, this vault is my digital brain — open-sourced to hopefully help **beginners** and **curious learners** like you.

> ⚠️ *Please note:* This is a work in progress. Since it's built alongside my own learning, there might be a few missing pieces or rough edges. But I’ve tried to keep everything clean, useful, and beginner-friendly.

## 🛠 Best Viewed In: **Obsidian**

While you're free to browse this vault in any markdown viewer, **I strongly recommend opening it with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** to get the full experience — backlinks, graph view, folders, and more. It’s where this vault really shines.

### Quick Start:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avadhoot1905/Web-Dev.git
```
Then open it as a vault in Obsidian.
