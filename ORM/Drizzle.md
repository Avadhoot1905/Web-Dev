[[Prisma]]
Drizzle ORM is similar to Prisma in some ways but has a different philosophy. It's lightweight, SQL-first, and type-safe while being more flexible with raw SQL queries. Here's how it compares to Prisma based on what you already know:

### 1. **Installation (Equivalent to npm i --save-dev prisma typescript ts-node)**
   sh
   npm install drizzle-orm @vercel/postgres kysely
   
   - drizzle-orm: The core Drizzle library.
   - @vercel/postgres: (For PostgreSQL) You can replace it with better-sqlite3, mysql2, etc.
   - kysely: Helps with type-safe query building.

### 2. **Initialization (Equivalent to npx prisma init --database-provider (db name))
   
   Drizzle doesn't have a CLI tool like Prisma, but you create a schema file manually:
   - Create a drizzle/ directory.
   - Define your schema in a TypeScript file (schema.ts).

   Example (schema.ts for PostgreSQL):
   ```ts
   import { pgTable, serial, text, varchar } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

   export const users = pgTable("users", {
       id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
       name: text("name").notNull(),
       email: varchar("email", 255).unique().notNull(),
   });
   ```

### 3. **Generating Migrations (Equivalent to npx prisma generate)**
   
   - Drizzle uses raw SQL migrations. You generate a migration like this:

```sh
npx drizzle-kit generate
     ```

   - Apply the migration:

```sh
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 4. *Using the ORM (Equivalent to Prisma Client)*
   - Prisma uses prisma.client.ts, whereas Drizzle connects directly.
   - Example of querying data:

``` ts
     import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/vercel-postgres";
     import { sql } from "@vercel/postgres";
     import { users } from "./schema";

     const db = drizzle(sql);

     async function getUsers() {
         return await db.select().from(users);
     }
```     

### *Key Differences from Prisma*
- *Drizzle has no global CLI like Prisma* (prisma migrate, prisma studio, etc.).
- *Drizzle migrations are raw SQL-based*, not JSON snapshots like Prisma.
- *Drizzle is SQL-first*, meaning you write migrations manually or generate them using drizzle-kit.
- *Prisma is more opinionated* and has an abstraction layer, while Drizzle gives you more SQL control.
